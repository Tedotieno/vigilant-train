## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Ello's Fullstack Engineering challenge to be assesessed by the Engineering team for a FullStack role with a frontend focus.

## Features üèé

- Simple Auth with localStorage and context
- Search bar preloaded with books that can be assigned to a reading list
- A well tiled grid displaying the books in the reading list, responsive across different screen sizes
- Ability to be able to remove a book from the reading list
- Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure, written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- A variety of custom light-weight UI components such as BookCard, BookSearch and Navigation

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/Tedotieno/vigilant-train.git`
- `npm run install` to install the dependencies in both the frontend and backend directory
- After having the dependencies installed, In the backend folder/directory run `npm run start` to spin up the server which i beleive should run on `http://localhost:4000/`
- In another terminal tab, proceed to the frontend folder/directory and run `npm run dev`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:5173/`

## What's missing?

Ran out of time there's still a few things I would have implemented

- Some form of virtualization for our list, though it's not that long, maybe pagination or infinite scrolling as well.
- Performance optimizations/improvments
- Some elements can still need be tweaked properly to be responsive across the different screen sizes
- Testing
- Etc, etc, etc ... Lol

I had a ton of fun designing & building this, hope you like what you see, with love ‚ù§Ô∏è
